# Bebian Redesign

Some time ago, I shared a couple of Debian logo redesigns ( v1 / v2 ). Thanks to all the feedback from those posts, I’ve created a new version that I’m finally happy with.
I’m also releasing all the source files in multiple formats (.png, .jpg, .svg, .eps), as I now consider it production ready :)

Font used: Lexend
File formats: .PNG, .JPG, .SVG, .EPS

Hope you like it!
P.S. While I’d love to see an official visual refresh of the Debian logo someday, this is just a fan-made redesign.
